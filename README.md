# 🧠 Machine Learning Specialization Notes (Andrew Ng, Stanford)

This repository contains my structured notes from the  
**Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng**, focusing on:

- ✅ Unsupervised Learning  
- ✅ Recommendations & PCA  
- ✅ Reinforcement Learning  
- (More sections coming as I continue the specialization)

The notes are written cleanly in **Markdown**, formatted for GitHub, and include  
key formulas, algorithms, intuition, and important takeaways.
